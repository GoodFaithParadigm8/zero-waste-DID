Zero Waste Decentralized Identifier Proposal

The purpose of this repo is to begin creating protocols to utilize __Decentralized Identifiers__ for waste mitigation purposes. Our goal is to create JSON-LD specifications for the spectrum of materials (metals, paper/cardboard, glass, plastic, hazardous waste, electronic e-waste), their respective weights, and pre and post processing handling to empower the reporting and tracking of repurposing recycled materials.
